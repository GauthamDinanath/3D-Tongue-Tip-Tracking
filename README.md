# 3D-Tongue-Tip-Tracking

Motivation:  Patients undergoing surgery and/or radiotherapy in the oral region, especially the tongue, have the
risk of limited tongue mobility with serious deterioration of oral functions, such as speech, food transport,
swallowing, and mastication. To measure the range of motion, patients are asked to move their tongue to
standardized, extreme positions, left, right, forward, downward and upward

Problem statement: Develop and test a method that is able to track the tip of the tongue and some facial landmarks
so as to find the 3D positions of these points.

Dataset: University provided dataset containing videos of 3 subjects moving the tongue to the standardized extreme postions taken using a triple camera setup. 

Approach:Two approaches were tried:

1.Optical flow method:
  
2.Contrast segmentation method ( When markers were used to annotate the tip of the tongue )
